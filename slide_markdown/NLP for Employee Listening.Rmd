## NLP for Employee Listening 

<div class="columns-2">
<br><br>
So... I have a 10-month old daughter, and have been doing a lot of Natural Language Processing (NLP) work lately. 

Thus, it is only appropriate for me to marry some NLP thinking with nursery rhymes.  

- **NLP nimble**: Act on insights in near-real time
- **NLP quick**: It's never been easier get started doing NLP 
- **NLP the candle stick**: don't burn the trust of your colleagues!

## Nimble: React to company-specifc issues

Text analysis/NLP used in a continuous listening strategy comprised of both:

1) Open-ended questions in frequent pulse surveys 
2) Observation of aggregate themes/trends on enterprise social media platforms 

... allows you to act fast and help your employees adapt to change quickly.

### **Major company events:**

- Pulse surveys: **"What do you need from your manager in light of our recent spin-off announcement?"**
- Aggregated social media data: **Posts containing "spin-off" or "acquisition"**
  
### **Employer brand:**

- Pulse surveys: **What steps should we take to make our company a great place to work?**
- Aggregated social media data: **Posts containing "spin-off" or "acquisition"**

## Nimble: React to societal issues 

<font size="4">

- COVID-19 and adapting to change:
  - Pulse surveys: What's the biggest barrier to getting your work done at home?"
  - Aggregated data from public posts on internal social media: Posts containing 'work from home' or 'WFH'

- Racial Justice and Diversity and Inclusion:
  - Aggregated data from public posts on internal social media: Posts containing 'George Floyd', 'Diversity and Inclusion', etc.

## NLP Quick: It's never been easier to get started

**All you need**

- Text data in a spreadsheet

- Time and (free) tools to:
    - Clean text data
    - Slice and Aggregate text data by attribute, time frame, or topic of interest

## NLP Quick: Don't make it complicated

- Top two-word phrases (phrase cloud)

- Comments surfacing specific 

## NLP the candle stick: Earn your employees trust! Or get burned.

**Never EVER** 
- Focus on the individual!

*ALWAYS*

- Communicate to your employees:
  - Intention of using their responses or activity on corporate systems
  - Your aggregation and privacy policies
  
- Have an aggregation policy that
  - Sets a minimum number of comments/posts that guarantees anonymity (usually 20).
  - Describes how you will share data
