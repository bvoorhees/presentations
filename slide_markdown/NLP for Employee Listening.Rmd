## NLP for Employee Listening 

<div class="columns-2">
<br><br>
So... I have a 10-month old daughter, and have been doing a lot of Natural Language Processing (NLP) work lately. 

Thus, it is only appropriate for me to marry some NLP thinking with nursery rhymes.  

- **NLP nimble**: Act on insights in near-real time
- **NLP quick**: It's never been easier get started doing NLP 
- **NLP the candle stick**: don't burn the trust of your colleagues!

## Nimble: React to company-specifc issues

Text analysis/NLP used in a continuous listening strategy comprised of both:

1) Open-ended questions in frequent pulse surveys 
2) Observation of aggregate themes/trends on enterprise social media platforms 

... allows you to act fast and help your employees adapt to change quickly.

### **Major company events:**

- Pulse surveys: **"What do you need from leaders in light of our recent spin-off announcement?"**
- Aggregated social media data: **Posts containing "spin-off" or "acquisition"**
  
### **Employer brand:**

- Pulse surveys: **What steps should we take to make our company a great place to work?**
- Aggregated social media data: **Posts containing "proud" or "fulfilling"**

## Nimble: React to societal issues 

### **COVID-19 and adapting to change**
- Pulse surveys: **"What's the biggest barrier to getting your work done at home?"**
- Aggregated data from public posts on internal social media: **Posts containing 'work from home' or 'WFH'**

### **Racial Justice and Diversity and Inclusion**
- Aggregated data from public posts on internal social media: Posts containing 'George Floyd', 'Diversity and Inclusion', etc.

## NLP Quick: It's never been easier to get started

**All you need**

- Text data in a spreadsheet

- Time and (free) tools to:
    - Clean text data
    - Slice and Aggregate text data by attribute, time frame, or topic of interest

## NLP Quick: Don't make it complicated

### Letting the data speak for itself
- "What are people talking about generally?"
- Top two-word phrases (*Bigram frequency Analysis*)

### Look for specific words or phrases
- "What are people talking about when they mention X"
- Word/phrase search, followed by top two-word phrases

## NLP the candle stick: Don't burn your colleagues' trust!

**Never EVER** 
- Focus on the individual
- Expose insights that can identify an individual

*ALWAYS*

1. Understand what you're doing with modeling or sentiment analysis:
  - Do you understand how algorithms affect your conclusions? 
  - Are you enough of a linguist to trust sentiment scores?
2. Are you being lazy?
  - Computers aren't a substitute for old-fashioned reading
2. Have an aggregation policy that
  - Sets a minimum number of comments/posts that guarantees anonymity (usually 20).
  - Describes how you will share data with others
3. Communicate to your employees:
  - Intention of using their responses or activity on corporate systems **for good!**
  - Who gets to see their information
  - Your aggregation and privacy policies
